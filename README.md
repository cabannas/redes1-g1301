# Protocol Practicum - Computer Networks 1 Project

## Description
The "Protocol Practicum" is a practical project undertaken for the Computer Networks 1 course, part of the Computer Engineering degree at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid in 2019. The project's aim was to provide hands-on experience with the fundamental protocols that are the backbone of the internet, including UDP, TCP, ICMP, and ARP. Through this initiative, students were able to delve into the workings of network communication, protocol design, and implementation.

### Prerequisites
- A Unix/Linux operating system
- GCC or another C/C++ compiler
- Networking tools like Wireshark for protocol analysis
- Access to a network environment for testing protocol implementation

## Development
In 2019, Daniel Cabanas and Xingxin Chen Zhan at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid embarked on a journey to understand and implement the core protocols that enable network communication. The "Protocol Practicum" project was instrumental in teaching the intricacies of how data is encapsulated and transferred across networks. By programming and simulating UDP, TCP, ICMP, and ARP, students gained valuable insight into network operations and the challenges of reliable data exchange.
